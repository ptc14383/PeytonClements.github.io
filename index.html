<h1 style=font-family:Papyrus>Introduction</h1>
<p style=font-family:Papyrus>The art of astrology has been practiced throughout human history as a means of divining a person's innate qualities by observing the stars under which they were born. From ancient Babylon to modern America, various forms of astrology are still being studied and perfected today. However, this practice is not uniform across the globe. In China, a person's qualities are explained by a variety of animal archetypes as well as the five Chinese elements: metal, wood, earth, fire, and water. Indian astrology, on the other hand, heavily incorporates Vedic teachings and Hindu deities when prescribing someone's personality traits. In this analysis, we will be discussing the more well-known Western school of astrology. This form of astrology uses the position of planets relative to certain constellations to predict how an individual willbehave throughout their life. These constellations (or signs) in the order that they occur in the astrological cycle are as follows: 
<div style=font-family:papyrus>
<ul>
<li><i>Aries</i></li><li><i>Taurus</i></li><li><i>Gemini</i></li><li><i>Cancer</i></li><li><i>Leo</i></li><li><i>Virgo</i></li><li><i>Libra</i></li><li><i>Scorpio</i></li><li><i>Sagittarius</i></li><li><i>Capricorn</i></li><li><i>Aquarius</i></li><li><i>Pisces</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p style=font-family:papyrus>All of the planets in our solar system play a role in astrology as well, but for the sake of brevity, we will only discuss the sun and its interactions with the 12 signs.</p>
<h3 style=font-family:Papyrus>Dualities</h3>
<p style=font-family:Papyrus>Each sign that the sun could fall under at the time of one's birth is either <b>masculine</b> or <b>feminine</b>. This quality is referred to as a sign's <b>duality</b>. The signs Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius are all considered to have a masculine duality. This means that anyone born with the sun in any of the aforementioned signs is likely to be a person who is proactive, extroverted, and interactive. The signs Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces, on the other hand, have a feminine duality. Someone born under one of these signs is likely to be reactive, introverted, and perceptive.</p>
<h3 style=font-family:Papyrus>Triplicities</h3>
<p style=font-family:Papyrus>The four classical elements <b>fire</b>, <b>earth</b>, <b>water</b>, and <b>air</b> are used to denote a sign's <b>triplicity</b>. Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are all fire signs. People born with the sun in one of these signs tend to be passionate and aggressive in everything they do. The earth signs, Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, are characterised as being modest, traditional, and wordly in their outlooks. Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius are air signs and impart a tendency to be analytical and objective. Oppositely, the water signs Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces rely on intuition and their strongly-felt emotions.</p>
<h3 style=font-family:Papyrus>Quadruplicities</h3>
<p style=font-family:Papyrus>Each astrological sign is described as being either <b>cardinal</b>, <b>fixed</b>, or <b>mutable</b>. This is known as a sign's <b>quadruplicity</b>. The cardinal signs, Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn impart the quality of being initiators and enterprisers. Those born under a cardinal sun sign tend to be the people start major undertakings. The fixed signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius, tend give a person a strong stubborness. Those with a fixed sun sign are prone to resisting change in all of its forms. Finally, the mutable signs Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces are characterised by being highly adaptable to new situations. People born under one of these signs perform well in new, adverse situations relative to the other signs.</p>
<h1 style=font-family:Papyrus>All Qualities in Unison</h1>
<p style=font-family:Papyrus>A sign's specific combination of dualities, triplicities, and quadruplicities works to make that sign unique from others. Below is a table that includes these characteristics as well as the sign's symbol, it's associated planet, and a short description of traits imparted when the sign is conjoined with the sun.</p>

<div style=font-family:papyrus><u><b>Note:</b></u> By looking at the chart, one notices patterns within the dualities, triplicities, and qudruplicities. These patterns can be used to memorise the order of the signs in the astrological cycle. Additionally, one may determine the qualities of one sign if they know the sign that precedes or follows it.</div>

<h3 style=font-family:papyrus>Finding Your Astrological Sign</h3>
<p style=font-family:Papyrus>Of all the planets that affect a person's astrological makeup, the sun is the easiest one to track. A person's month and date of birth, regardless of the year they were born, is enough to determine one's sun sign. The key below lists birthdays and the corresponding sun sign.</p>

<h3 style=font-family:Papyrus>Explaining Inaccuracies</h3>
<p style=font-family:papyrus>For some, the information provided by this page may seem spot-on. For others, however, there may be so many inaccuracies that the reader is led to the conclusion that astrology is simply false. Before this notion is solidified, consider the reasons why a person's supposed sun sign qualities could be so innacurate:
<div style=font-family:papyrus>
<ol>
<li>The person does not take into account the effects of other planets within their astrological chart</li>
<Li>The sun was passing through a debilitating sign (Aquarius or Libra) when the person was born, thereby allowing their sun sign to be overpowered by other signs in their chart</li>
<li>Astrology is a study of trends, not absolutes; all trends have outliers</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h1 style=font-family:papyrus><u>In Closing</h1>
